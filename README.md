## Overview

The Bot Battlr App is a dynamic web-based application designed for bot enthusiasts. While it is not a traditional game, it offers users the ability to create, customize, and enlist bots for their "army." This project's primary focus is to provide users with the following key functionalities:

- View profiles of all bots rendered in the `BotCollection` component.
- Add individual bots to your army by clicking on them. A bot can be enlisted only once.
